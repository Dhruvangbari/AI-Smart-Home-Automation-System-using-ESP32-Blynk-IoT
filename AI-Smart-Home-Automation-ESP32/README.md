# AI Smart Home Automation System (ESP32 + Blynk) 🏠🤖

Advanced smart home automation with AI-style rules, scene management, and modular architecture.
Smart automation powered by sensor-driven intelligence.

This project implements an **AI-inspired Smart Home Automation System** using an **ESP32**, environmental sensors, relay modules, and **Blynk IoT cloud**.

Unlike basic automation projects, this system introduces **decision-based automation logic** and **scene management**, allowing the home to adapt automatically to changing environmental conditions.

Smart sensing. Intelligent decisions. Automated home control.
